Greetings! I am an Associate Professor in the [Computer Science Department](https://cs.wwu.edu), [Western Washington University](https://www.wwu.edu). I completed my Ph.D. in computer science from [Simon Fraser University](https://www.sfu.ca) under the supervision of [Dr. Anoop Sarkar](https://www.cs.sfu.ca/~anoop/). My research broadly falls into natural language processing. My other research work involves application of eye-tracking data in biometrics and ethics education in AI courses.
